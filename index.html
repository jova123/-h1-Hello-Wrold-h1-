				<h1>All About The Stinking Bat</h1>
				<p><a =>He dresses up in a Bat costune and beats people up every single night.
				God forbid he spends one night at home, the streets of Gotham will fall to ruins. (so he thinks) But I truly believe that something traumatic must have happened to the Bat..cause no one dresses up in a costume and tortures men, unless they're me! HAHA!</p>


				<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Driving himself slowly into madness</li>
					<li>Great at never killing Yours Truly</li>
				</ul>

					"I am the night...I am Batman" Blah blah blah! You know, if you really wanted to see fear then come on in to Arkham Asylum! Thats where they'll really give you a fright! 
				</p>

				<h2>Accomplishments</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Got rid of the competition that I had to deal with, for example, that disgusting man Cobblepot.</li>
					<li>I guess another thing he succeeded in was keeping that poor butler of his Alfred, safe from my pretty hands.</li>
